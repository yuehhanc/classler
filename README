1.Initiate docker according to README in folder “setup”

2.In setup/create_docker.sh, the path in the front of “:” is the path on your machine. On the other hand, the path in the rear of “:” is the path in docker.

3.In setup/start_docker.sh, use the path in docker to find your files for executions.

4.Put folder “python” at the path where your docker runs on your machine (the path in step 2)
